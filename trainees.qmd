We propose a predator–prey–disease model described by reaction–diffusion equations with nonlocal delays, featuring disease transmission within the prey population and intra- and interspecific predator competition. The model explicitly incorporates predator-induced fear and Allee effects; rigorous analysis will reveal thresholds and spatial–temporal dynamics that inform interdisciplinary conservation strategies. Supervisor: Dr. Yuan Yuan.

I develop a copula-based joint modelling framework that links the latent error components of vaccination uptake and hospitalization outcomes to address endogeneity from unobserved risk perception. Nonlinear covariate effects are handled in the marginal mean equations via flexible splines, while the copula governs dependence (including tail behavior) and can vary over space and time. This yields credible, policy-relevant estimates of vaccine effectiveness that advance ACCDMi’s disease-ecology and evidence-informed public-health objectives in Atlantic Canada. Supervisor: Dr. Cindy Feng.

I have developed a mathematical model to estimate the average number of avian influenza virus infections in humans using data describing the interpandemic periods for the seven influenza pandemics that occurred over the last 245 years. This will help determine the risk of emergence of pandemic influenza. I am also studying how wild bird migrations and disease spread would produce seasonal effects in the risk of human infection within years during the interpandemic period. Supervisor: Dr. Amy Hurford.

I conduct research on infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) in Atlantic salmon, integrating scoping reviews, systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy, and evaluation of antimicrobial and antiparasitic use across Canada and other salmon-producing countries to inform evidence-based management. My work examines surveillance strategies, outbreak dynamics, and the effectiveness of interventions, all within a One Health framework. This approach generates actionable insights for disease ecology and sustainable aquaculture, supporting ACCDMi’s objectives in advancing disease forecasting, control strategies, and One Health approaches. Supervisors: Drs. Krishna Thakur and Javier Sanchez.

I developed a temporal network analysis framework to assess the role of hatcheries and marine sites in the potential spread of infectious diseases among Atlantic salmon sites using fish transfer data. Building on this, I plan to extend the work by simulating the spread of specific viral and bacterial pathogens through a network-based modelling approach to better understand transmission pathways from freshwater hatcheries to marine net-pen sites, as well as within and between marine sites. Additionally, I have conducted a systematic review synthesizing current knowledge on the transmission dynamics of ISAV, providing an evidence base to inform modelling and surveillance strategies. In parallel, I am applying multiple-membership (MM) Cox proportional hazards models to identify risk factors associated with the time to first detection of infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) across Atlantic Canada, accounting for shared influences from both hatcheries (MM) and marine sites (frailty). I am also conducting space-time cluster analyses to detect high-risk clusters and hotspots of ISAV occurrence. Supervisors: Drs. Javier Sanchez and Krishna Kumar Thakur.

My research integrates large-scale, publicly available aquaculture datasets to investigate environmental and management factors that influence salmon health and disease dynamics. Through the application of hierarchical mixed-effects, time-series, and regression models, it quantifies patterns of mortality and sea lice infestation and evaluates the regulatory equivalence of sea lice thresholds across major salmon-producing regions. Supervisors: Drs. Javier Sanchez and Krishna Thakur.
