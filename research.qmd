ACCDMi researchers use data science, applied mathematics, and statistics to advance disease ecology modelling.  

### 1. ONE Health and zoonotic infections
Projects: Avian influenza models, spillover risk, amphibian disease ecology.  

### 2. Stochastic modelling, epidemic forecasting, and small jurisdictions
Projects: Inference for stochastic models, epidemic forecasting, spatial-temporal risk in small communities, outbreak modelling, stochastic control, and advocacy for small jurisdictions.  

### 3. Dynamical systems and control in disease ecology
Projects: Hybrid dispersal models, imperfect vaccination, tumour models with therapy, seasonality and dispersal, and optimal control strategies.  

### 4. Modelling education
Projects: Online outreach resources, local outreach events, and training workshops.
