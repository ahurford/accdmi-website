ACCDMi researchers use data science, applied mathematics, and statistics to advance disease ecology modelling.  

### 1. ONE Health and zoonotic infections (Led by Dr. Javier Sanchez)
Projects: Avian influenza models, spillover risk, amphibian disease ecology.

- Baafi, J. and A. Hurford. [Effect of Climate Warming on Mosquito Population Dynamics in Newfoundland](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.07.674692v1). Under review at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology.

### 2. Stochastic modelling, epidemic forecasting, and small jurisdictions (Led by Dr. Edward Susko)
Projects: Inference for stochastic models, epidemic forecasting, spatial-temporal risk in small communities, outbreak modelling, stochastic control, and advocacy for small jurisdictions. 

- Anokye, F., M. WZ Li, S. Walker, and A. Hurford. [Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant spread and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.26.25336738v1). Under review at PLoS Computational Biology.

### 3. Dynamical systems and control in disease ecology
Projects: Hybrid dispersal models, imperfect vaccination, tumour models with therapy, seasonality and dispersal, and optimal control strategies.  

### 4. Modelling education (Led by Dr. Amy Hurford)
Projects: Online outreach resources, local outreach events, and training workshops.
