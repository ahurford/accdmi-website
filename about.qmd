# About

The Atlantic Canada Center for Disease Ecology Modelling (ACCDMi) will consolidate and describe our expertise. Programs will build relationships and capacity through training, outreach, and collaborative partnerships.  

We focus on:

- **Improving analyses** by incorporating efficient algorithms, modelling approaches, and perspectives from applied mathematics and statistics.  
- **Supporting small jurisdictions** that face unique modelling needs.  
- **Advocating for mathematics and statistics** to be recognized as essential in applied health sciences.  

ACCDMi is a step toward establishing a **national modelling institute** and ensuring that Atlantic Canada is a strong contributor to future national initiatives.
